      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Adefiola Adeniyi, Deffy for short, or Dee. A recent graduate
        of English language in the University of Ilorin, and an aspiring
        Engineer from Lagos, Nigeria with a passion for learning and solving
        problems. I'm from Ondo state but I've stayed in Lagos all my life,
        apart from the few years spent in school. I recently began my journey
        into Front-End Development and although it has been a little
        challenging, it has also been very rewarding. The joy I experience
        whenever I get things right, or solve a problem is unmatched, and it is
        a feeling I want to keep chasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goals in this field is to be someone that creates solution
        irrespective of the field I find myself in. I also plan to be flexible
        and teachable so as to grow in this career. Joining Altschool Africa was
        an important decision which was fueled by my desire for a brighter
        future for myself and to create a meaningful career in technology. As
        the world becomes increasingly driven by technology, I decided to pick
        up a tech skill, so as to adapt in the evolving landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a fresh graduate of English language, I have always been fasinated by
        the power of communication and creativity, and I have always longed for
        a career that combines these strengths with skills that are in demand
        globally, and I believe Front-End development does just that. It offers
        a unique blend of creativity and logic, where I can design and develop
        interfaces and bring my ideas to life with code.
